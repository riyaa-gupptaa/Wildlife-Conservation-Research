Wildlife Conservation Strategies: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach
Overview
This repository contains my independent research paper, "Agent-Based Simulation of Wildlife Conservation Strategies". The study leverages Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and Monte Carlo Simulation to explore innovative and adaptive approaches for tackling challenges in wildlife conservation. The research addresses critical issues such as habitat preservation, population dynamics, and biodiversity protection.

Key Highlights
Agent-Based Modeling: Simulates species population dynamics, interactions, and ecological changes.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Incorporates stochasticity to assess varying conservation outcomes.
Technological Integration: Explores tools like AI, drones, and GIS for monitoring and preservation.
Sustainable Conservation Strategies: Evaluate habitat restoration, land-use planning, and threat reduction.

Abstract
The research investigates how ABM and Monte Carlo Simulation can optimize wildlife conservation strategies. By simulating interactions between agents (animals, humans, and the environment), it provides actionable insights for habitat preservation and biodiversity enhancement. The study also addresses challenges such as ethical concerns, technological limitations, and financial constraints, offering recommendations for real-world implementation
